  ## 👀 About This Repository
  #### 💡 This is the file store where I practiced React.
  #### 📖 I am Korean, I inform you that all the comments are written in Korean.
  #### ❗ It's not been long since I've learned React, so the code can be messy, weird, or inefficient.
  #### 🫠 It's for personal study, but I often copy and upload external files.
